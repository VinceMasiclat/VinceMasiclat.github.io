### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 is one of my favorites because it utilizes both doubles and integers. Since it is working with decimals there were a lot of doubles being used. This one was pretty challenging for me and my partner because of this, but in a good way.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 is one of my favorites because it is one of the first actual coding projects I completed. It is a pretty basic code introducing integers and std::cout. My partner and I were very excited when we finished this code. 

* Lab 9
    Lab 9, part 1 was one of the more challenging labs for me. Me and my partner had to use boolean function, loops, if statements, and integers to determine if a schedule is valid. Though it was challenging it was satisfying when we finished it.
